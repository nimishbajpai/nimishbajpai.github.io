## Project Summary

Using Fannie Mae loan performance data from 2004 to 2010, I built a logistic regression model to estimate the lifetime probability of default (PD) for home loans.

### Objective

To predict if a loan will ever become 90+ days delinquent using origination features.

### Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- WOE encoding of categorical variables
- Feature selection
- Logistic regression modeling
- Model evaluation (AUC, KS, confusion matrix)

### Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

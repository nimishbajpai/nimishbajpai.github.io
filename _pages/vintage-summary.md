Conducted exposure-weighted vintage analysis using Fannie Mae single-family loan data (2004â€“2010).  
Built a quarterly vintage matrix of 90+ DPD defaulted UPB, and visualized cumulative default rates using a heatmap.

---

### Key Highlights

- Cleaned, joined and transformed 2000â€“2010 vintage Fannie Mae loan performance data for Wells Fargo loans
- Created flags for delinquency buckets (DLQ 1/2/3/4)
- Calculated months-to-default relative to origination
- Grouped by origination quarter to build a vintage-default matrix
- Normalized using original UPB* to calculate % defaulted
- Visualized using annotated seaborn heatmaps

*UPB: Unpaid Balance

### Key Takeaways

- 2006â€“2007 vintages experienced the highest cumulative default rates, peaking at 12â€“13% of original UPB, clearly reflecting pre-crisis underwriting risk.
- Post-2008 vintages show significantly improved performance with <2% default rates, likely due to tighter credit standards and policy intervention.
- Default rates were front-loaded, with the majority of defaults occurring within the first 24â€“36 months of loan origination.
- The heatmap visualization helps identify high-risk vintages and timing of deterioration at a glance â€” useful for portfolio monitoring and capital planning.
- Demonstrates a complete lifecycle view of mortgage portfolio risk using real-world delinquency data and custom Python visualization.
